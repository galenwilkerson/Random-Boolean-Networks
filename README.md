# Random Boolean Networks Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `RBN.ipynb`, which is focused on the analysis and exploration of Random Boolean Networks (RBNs). RBNs are a model of computation often used to represent and study complex systems, genetic regulatory networks, and neural networks.

## Description

The `RBN.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of Random Boolean Networks, including their construction, behavior analysis, and potential applications. The analysis aims to shed light on the dynamic properties of RBNs and their relevance in various fields of study.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed, along with the Jupyter Notebook environment. If you don't have Python or Jupyter installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Jupyter using Pip:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Random-Boolean-Networks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd Random-Boolean-Networks
   ```
3. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `RBN.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
